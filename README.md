My name is Param Dave. I am a Cyber Security Consultant with hands-on professional experience in various domains within Cyber Security. Following areas are my primary focus of research - Penetration Testing, Threat Hunting, Red Teaming, and Purple Teaming.

## Objective
Cyber Security has fascinated me since my college days with it's everchanging landscape. We live in a digital age where technology is rapidly evolving, making Cyber Security a necessity for any organization. I aim to simplify this rather complex field and make it more accessible to everyone through sharing guidance, learning resources, and my research on various aspects of Cyber Security. I also intend to encourage as many people as possible to pursue this field.
